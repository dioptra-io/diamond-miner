> D-Miner is the first Internet-scale system that captures a multipath view of the topology.
> By combining and adapting state-of-the-art multipath detection and high speed randomized topology discovery techniques,
> D-Miner permits discovery of the Internetâ€™s multipath topology in 2.5 days[^1] when probing at 100kpps.[^2]

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

`diamond-miner` is a Python library to build large-scale Internet topology surveys.
It implements the Diamond-Miner algorithm to map load-balanced paths,
but it can also be used to implement other kind of measurements such as [Yarrp]((https://github.com/cmand/yarrp))-style traceroutes.

To get started, install Diamond-Miner and head over to the [documentation](https://dioptra-io.github.io/diamond-miner/):
```bash
# Requires Python 3.10+
pip install diamond-miner
```

## Publication

Diamond-Miner has been presented and published at [NSDI 2020](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/vermeulen).
Since then, the code has been refactored and separated in the [`diamond-miner`](https://github.com/dioptra-io/diamond-miner) and [`caracal`](https://github.com/dioptra-io/caracal) repositories.
The code as it was at the time of the publication is available in the [`diamond-miner-cpp`](https://github.com/dioptra-io/diamond-miner-cpp) and [`diamond-miner-wrapper`](https://github.com/dioptra-io/diamond-miner-wrapper) repositories.
