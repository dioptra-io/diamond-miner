> D-Miner is the first Internet-scale system that captures a multipath view of the topology. By combining and adapting state-of-the-art multipath detection and high speed randomized topology discovery techniques, D-Miner permits discovery of the Internet’s multipath topology in 2.5 days when probing at 100kpps.

## :rocket: Quickstart

Diamond-Miner is implemented as a Python library which computes the probes to send.
To actually send the probes, we recommend [Caracal](https://github.com/dioptra-io/caracal) but you can use the tool of your liking, such as [yarrp](https://github.com/cmand/yarrp) or [scamper](https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/scamper/) as long as you convert its output to the expected format described in the documentation.

To get started, install Diamond-Miner and head over to the [documentation](https://dioptra-io.github.io/diamond-miner/):
```bash
pip install diamond-miner
```

## Publications

Diamond-Miner has been presented and published at [NSDI 2020](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/vermeulen).
Since then, the code has been refactored and separated in the [diamond-miner](https://github.com/dioptra-io/diamond-miner) and [caracal](https://github.com/dioptra-io/caracal) repositories.
The code as it was at the time of the publication is available in the [`nsdi2020`](https://github.com/dioptra-io/diamond-miner/releases/tag/nsdi2020) tag.
