## Test data

Most tests require a running instance of ClickHouse with pre-populated tables.
To start a ClickHouse server and insert the test data:
```bash
docker run --rm -d -p 8123:8123 clickhouse/clickhouse-server:22.6
poetry run python tests/data/insert.py
```

To use a different server, set the `DIAMOND_MINER_TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable (`http://localhost:8123` by default).
